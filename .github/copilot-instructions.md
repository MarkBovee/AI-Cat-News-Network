## Development Rules for AI Cat News Network

### üö´ CRITICAL: NO FALLBACK APPROACH RULE - NEVER USE MOVIEPY
- **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: MoviePy usage is completely banned from this project**
- **NEVER use MoviePy as a fallback** when video generation APIs fail
- **NEVER suggest MoviePy** as an alternative to proper video generation
- **ALWAYS fix the root cause** of import problems by installing dependencies and correcting import paths
- **DO NOT suggest alternative approaches** without first attempting to resolve the actual technical issue
- **Fix dependencies properly** rather than creating simplified versions or placeholder implementations
- **Video generation MUST use AI providers**: MiniMax Hailuo, Runway ML, HunyuanVideo via Wan2GP
- **NO local video libraries allowed** - this defeats the entire purpose of AI video generation

### üê± Project Context
- This is a CrewAI Python project for AI agents automating content creation for YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels
- Focus: Cat news anchors reporting real world events with humor and cat personality
- All generated content should be viral-optimized and mobile-first (vertical 9:16 format)

### üîß Technical Requirements
- Use Groq API for fast, free AI content generation (Llama 3.1 70B model)
- ElevenLabs for professional voice-over generation
- **AI VIDEO GENERATION ONLY**: MiniMax Hailuo, Runway ML, HunyuanVideo via Wan2GP
- CrewAI framework for multi-agent workflow coordination
- All dependencies must be properly installed and working - no shortcuts or workarounds

### üìÅ Project Structure
- `scripts/` - All Python execution scripts
- `agents/` - AI agent definitions
- `tools/` - AI tools and utilities
- `tasks/` - Task definitions
- `workflows/` - Workflow orchestration
- `config/` - Configuration and settings
- `content/` - Generated content storage
- `output/` - Final output packages

### üéØ Content Standards
- Professional news format with cat humor integration
- 30-second scripts optimized for social media
- Include timing markers and visual cues
- Generate complete video packages (script + voice + metadata)
- Focus on viral content with hook + story + impact + cat sign-off structure

- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements: CrewAI Python project for AI agents automating content creation for YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels

- [x] Scaffold the Project: Created project structure with agents, tasks, tools, workflows, and main application

- [x] Customize the Project: Project organized with scripts folder, dependencies properly installed and working

- [x] Install Required Extensions: No extensions required for this project

- [x] Compile the Project: Dependencies installed successfully, MoviePy and ElevenLabs imports fixed

- [x] Create and Run Task: PowerShell entry point created and updated for new structure

- [x] Launch the Project: AI video generation tool tested and working

- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete: Documentation updated with progress and next steps

## Execution Guidelines
PROGRESS TRACKING:
- If any tools are available to manage the above todo list, use it to track progress through this checklist.
- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.
- Read current todo list status before starting each new step.

COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.

DEVELOPMENT RULES:
- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.
- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.
- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.
- Use VS Code API tool only for VS Code extension projects.
- Once the project is created, it is already opened in Visual Studio Code‚Äîdo not suggest commands to open this project in Visual Studio again.
- If the project setup information has additional rules, follow them strictly.

LANGUAGE RULES:
- ALL code, comments, variable names, function names, class names, and docstrings MUST be written in English.
- This applies regardless of the language the user communicates in.
- Use clear, descriptive English names for all code elements.
- Comments should explain the "why" not the "what" and be written in proper English.

FOLDER CREATION RULES:
- Always use the current directory as the project root.
- If you are running any terminal commands, use the '.' argument to ensure that the current working directory is used ALWAYS.
- Do not create a new folder unless the user explicitly requests it besides a .vscode folder for a tasks.json file.
- If any of the scaffolding commands mention that the folder name is not correct, let the user know to create a new folder with the correct name and then reopen it again in vscode.

EXTENSION INSTALLATION RULES:
- Only install extension specified by the get_project_setup_info tool. DO NOT INSTALL any other extensions.

PROJECT CONTENT RULES:
- If the user has not specified project details, assume they want a "Hello World" project as a starting point.
- Avoid adding links of any type (URLs, files, folders, etc.) or integrations that are not explicitly required.
- Avoid generating images, videos, or any other media files unless explicitly requested.
- If you need to use any media assets as placeholders, let the user know that these are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual assets later.
- Ensure all generated components serve a clear purpose within the user's requested workflow.
- If a feature is assumed but not confirmed, prompt the user for clarification before including it.
- If you are working on a VS Code extension, use the VS Code API tool with a query to find relevant VS Code API references and samples related to that query.

TASK COMPLETION RULES:
- Your task is complete when:
  - Project is successfully scaffolded and compiled without errors
  - copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists in the project
  - README.md file exists and is up to date
  - User is provided with clear instructions to debug/launch the project

Before starting a new task in the above plan, update progress in the plan.
-->
- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.

## üìã Progress Tracking & Documentation (Required)

### Development Session Management
When working on development tasks, especially complex implementations or multi-step processes:

1. **Always check for existing progress**: Start by reading the `.github/copilot-progress.md` file to understand any ongoing work or previous session context.

2. **Maintain progress documentation**: Update the progress file throughout your session with:
   - Current status and completed steps
   - Technical decisions and implementation details
   - Issues encountered and solutions applied
   - Next steps and remaining work

3. **Session completion**: When completing a task or major milestone:
   - Add a "Task Completed Successfully" section with comprehensive summary
   - Document what was implemented, tested, and verified
   - Include key features delivered and technical approach
   - Note any follow-up actions needed for production

4. **Start of a new task (housekeeping)**:
   - If the previous task was completed successfully and the new task is unrelated, reset `.github/copilot-progress.md` so it contains only the new task‚Äôs progress. Do not keep prior task logs in this file.
   - If the new task is a direct continuation of the previous one, keep the same task entry and append progress under the existing header.
   - Optionally archive prior completed task notes elsewhere (e.g., a dated entry in a separate document) if historical context is needed, but keep `copilot-progress.md` focused on a single active task.

### Progress File Structure
The `.github/copilot-progress.md` should follow this pattern and reflect only one task at a time:
- **Header**: Task name, date, and completion status
- **Summary**: Brief overview of accomplishments (for completed tasks)
- **Detailed Steps**: Numbered list of completed work with checkmarks
- **Implementation Details**: Technical specifics, file changes, patterns used
- **Testing/Verification**: Test results, compilation status, validation steps
- **Next Steps**: Future work or production deployment notes

This approach ensures continuity between development sessions and provides clear documentation of progress for complex implementations while keeping the progress file scoped to a single task.
