# AI Cat News Network - Production Scripts

This directory contains the core production scripts for generating cat news content.

## üéØ Streamlined & Clean

All test scripts, demos, and unused code have been removed for a clean, production-focused codebase. The PowerShell launcher (`AI-Cat-News-Studio.ps1`) provides easy access to all four essential functions.

## ÔøΩ Content Integration

All scripts use the organized content structure in `content/` with automatic:
- File linking across pipeline stages
- Metadata generation and tracking
